      <description>I recently met an engineer at a large travel agency who had built a fun ML project for sending guests greetings. This was one of the company’s first forays into ML. The project did not generate any revenue, and their managers discouraged them from doing more work on ML.</description>

      <description>Healthcare is one of many sectors being transformed by AI. I have a personal interest in it, since my father worked on machine learning for diagnosis of liver diseases almost 40 years ago. It’s thanks partly to this work that I learned about AI from an early age.</description>
